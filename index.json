	"content": "\nIntroducing AWS PrivateLink AWS PrivateLink is a highly available, scalable technology that you can use to privately connect your VPC to services as if they were in your VPC. You do not need to use an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection to allow communication with the service from your private subnets. Therefore, you control the specific API endpoints, sites, and services that are reachable from your VPC.\nService providers The owner of a service is the service provider. Service providers include AWS, AWS Partners, and other AWS accounts. Service providers can host their services using AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, or using on-premises servers.\nEndpoint services A service provider creates an endpoint service to make their service available in a Region. A service provider must specify a load balancer when creating an endpoint service. The load balancer receives requests from service consumers and routes them to your service. By default, your endpoint service is not available to service consumers. You must add permissions that allow specific AWS principals to connect to your endpoint service.\nService names Each endpoint service is identified by a service name. A service consumer must specify the name of the service when creating a VPC endpoint. Service consumers can query the service names for AWS services. Service providers must share the names of their services with service consumers.\nService states The following are the possible states for an endpoint service:\nPending - The endpoint service is being created. Available - The endpoint service is available. Failed - The endpoint service could not be created. Deleting - The service provider deleted the endpoint service and deletion is in progress. Deleted - The endpoint service is deleted. Service consumers The user of a service is a service consumer. Service consumers can access endpoint services from AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, or from on-premises servers.\nVPC endpoints A service consumer creates a VPC endpoint to connect their VPC to an endpoint service. A service consumer must specify the service name of the endpoint service when creating a VPC endpoint. There are multiple types of VPC endpoints. You must create the type of VPC endpoint that\u0026rsquo;s required by the endpoint service.\nInterface - Create an interface endpoint to send TCP traffic to an endpoint service. Traffic destined for the endpoint service is resolved using DNS. GatewayLoadBalancer - Create a Gateway Load Balancer endpoint to send traffic to a fleet of virtual appliances using private IP addresses. You route traffic from your VPC to the Gateway Load Balancer endpoint using route tables. The Gateway Load Balancer distributes traffic to the virtual appliances and can scale with demand. There is another type of VPC endpoint, Gateway, which creates a gateway endpoint to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB. Gateway endpoints do not use AWS PrivateLink, unlike the other types of VPC endpoints.\nEndpoint network interfaces An endpoint network interface is a requester-managed network interface that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to an endpoint service. For each subnet that you specify when you create a VPC endpoint, we create an endpoint network interface in the subnet.\nIf a VPC endpoint supports IPv4, its endpoint network interfaces have IPv4 addresses. If a VPC endpoint supports IPv6, its endpoint network interfaces have IPv6 addresses. The IPv6 address for an endpoint network interface is unreachable from the internet. When you describe an endpoint network interface with an IPv6 address, notice that denyAllIgwTraffic is enabled.\nThe IP addresses of an endpoint network interface will not change during the lifetime of its VPC endpoint.\nEndpoint policies A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to a VPC endpoint. It determines which principals can use the VPC endpoint to access the endpoint service. The default VPC endpoint policy allows all actions by all principals on all resources over the VPC endpoint.\nEndpoint states When you create a VPC endpoint, the endpoint service receives a connection request. The service provider can accept or reject the request. If the service provider accepts the request, the service consumer can use the VPC endpoint after it enters the Available state.\nThe following are the possible states for a VPC endpoint:\nPendingAcceptance - The connection request is pending. This is the initial state if requests are manually accepted. Pending - The service provider accepted the connection request. This is the initial state if requests are automatically accepted. The VPC endpoint returns to this state if the service consumer modifies the VPC endpoint. Available - The VPC endpoint is available for use. Rejected - The service provider rejected the connection request. The service provider can also reject a connection after it is available for use. Expired - The connection request expired. Failed - The VPC endpoint could not be made available. Deleting - The service consumer deleted the VPC endpoint and deletion is in progress. Deleted - The VPC endpoint is deleted. Introducing VPN Site to Site One of the most common ways that customers connect securely to AWS from on premises is by using the AWS Site-to-Site VPN managed IPSec VPN solution. One key benefit our customers look for when using the service is not having to manage 3rd-party or custom VPN solutions built using EC2 instances. The native service is already built to be highly-available with two tunnels in two different Availability Zones and has native integration with AWS Transit Gateway (via a VPN attachment) which allows customers to scale the connectivity to multiple VPCs with a single Transit Gateway-based VPN connection.\nConcepts The following are the key concepts for Site-to-Site VPN:\nVPN connection: A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.\nVPN tunnel: An encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS.\nEach VPN connection includes two VPN tunnels which you can simultaneously use for high availability.\nCustomer gateway: An AWS resource which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device.\nCustomer gateway device: A physical device or software application on your side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.\nTarget gateway: A generic term for the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.\nVirtual private gateway: A virtual private gateway is the VPN endpoint on the Amazon side of your Site-to-Site VPN connection that can be attached to a single VPC.\nTransit gateway: A transit hub that can be used to interconnect multiple VPCs and on-premises networks, and as a VPN endpoint for the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.\n"

To avoid EC2 resources being used unevenly, (we often tend to use AZ a to run primary and AZ b to stand by, for example), AWS will randomly assign Availability Zone to ** Availability Zone ID**. We can understand that Availability Zone is a form of alias, and Availability Zone ID is the identifier. For example, in the image above Availability Zone ap-southeast-1a is assigned Availability Zone ID as apse1-az2. In another AWS account, Availability Zone ap-southeast-1a might have an Availability Zone ID of apse1-az1.\nEnable Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address for Public subnets Select PublicSubnet-OnPremise , select Actions, select Edit subnet settings Select Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address\nClick Save\nThe same is done with PublicSubnet-Provider\nSelect PublicSubnet-OnPremise , select Actions, select Edit subnet settings\nSelect Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address\nClick Save\nAnother notable point is that the subnets are basically the same.

	"content": "We can connect the On-premise data center to Amazon VPC using hard or soft VPN depending on the purpose and actual usage needs. To establish a Site to Site VPN connection, we will need to create and configure a Virtual Private Gateway VPG and a Customer Gateway CGW.\nVirtual Private Gateway (VPG) is a control center connecting the virtual private network (VPN) installed on top of AWS. A Customer Gateway (CGW) is a component that represents a hard or soft VPN device installed at the Customer end. VPN tunnel will be established immediately after data traffic is transmitted between AWS and the customer\u0026rsquo;s network. In that connection, we must specify the type of routing that will be used to ensure safety and quality in terms of data transmission. If the CGW on the customer side supports Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), then in the VPN connection configuration we must set the routing to dynamic routing. Otherwise, we must configure the connection routing as static routing. In case of using static routing, we must enter the exact necessary routes for the connection from the Customer side to the VPG set up at the AWS end. At the same time, routing for the VPC must also be configured to propagate to allow resources to exchange data in and out of the VPN tunnel connection between AWS and the Customer\u0026rsquo;s network system. Amazon VPC offers a variety of CGWs, and each CGW is assigned to a VPG, but a VPG can be associated with multiple CGWs (many-to-one design). . To support this model, CGW\u0026rsquo;s IP address must be unique within a region. Amazon VPC also provides the necessary information for Network Administrators to configure CGW and establish VPN connections to VPG on AWS. VPN connection always includes 2 Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) tunnels to ensure high availability of the connection. Below are the important features we need to know about VPG, CGW, and VPN: VPG is the front-end component of VPN tunnel located on AWS. CGW can be a hardware device or software application located on the Customer end of the VPN tunnel connection. You must initiate a VPN tunnel connection from CGWto VPG. VPG supports both dynamic routing (BGP) and static routing. VPN connection always has 2 tunnels to ensure high availability for connecting to VPC from the Customer site. The lab helps us learn how to establish a Site to Site VPN connection in AWS. In fact, this solution is quite popular due to its low cost and very easy configuration because AWS provides instructions for each type of device on the Customer end. The only thing the Customer cares about is preparing an internet connection to create a secure, secret tunnel (using IPSec) to connect to AWS through AWS VPN tunnel. Within the scope of the lab, assume that we have a Main office (VPC Consumer) and a Branch office (VPC Customer) located at 2 VPCs. On each VPC, create an EC2 that allows SSH from the outside, but does not have the ability to connect and ping each other using the Private IP address of each EC2. What we need to do is configure the VPN so that Private IP addresses can ping each other using Site-to-Site VPN.
